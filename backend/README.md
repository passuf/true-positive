# Backend

This folder houses True Positive's GraphQL API, written in Ruby on Rails. 

The frontend uses this API to create, retrieve, update, and delete cases,
tasks, and other objects.

You can also use the API on its own to automate tasks. Everything you can do
in the web interface, you can do via this API.
